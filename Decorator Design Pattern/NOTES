Both the Decorator and Observer design patterns share some similarities,
especially in how they allow for the extension of behavior,
but they operate differently and solve different types of problems.

Here’s a comparison that might clarify the connection:

Decorator Pattern:
Purpose: Allows you to dynamically add or modify the behavior of an object at runtime
without changing its class.

How it works: You wrap an object with additional functionality by creating a decorator
object that "decorates" the original object.
This allows for flexible and reusable behavior modifications.

Example: A Coffee class can be wrapped by different decorators like MilkDecorator,
SugarDecorator, etc., which dynamically change the coffee's behavior
(e.g., adding milk or sugar) without modifying the original Coffee class.

Observer Pattern:
Purpose: Allows one object (the subject) to notify multiple
dependent objects (observers) about state changes,
without the subject needing to know who or what the observers are.

How it works: The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them
whenever its state changes. The observers then react to the change,
usually by updating their own state.

Example: In a weather monitoring system, a WeatherStation (subject) notifies
multiple Display objects (observers) whenever there's a change in temperature.

Key Similarities:
Both patterns focus on extending behavior without modifying existing code.

Both use composition: The decorator pattern adds behavior by wrapping objects,
while the observer pattern adds behavior by allowing other objects to "listen" to state changes.

Key Differences:
Decorator: Works at the object level, where behavior is added dynamically
through composition and delegation.

Observer: Works at the system level, where objects (observers) are
notified of changes in another object’s state (the subject).

Why the Observer Pattern Can Feel Like the Decorator Pattern:
You’re right that the Observer pattern can feel like a dynamic change in behavior,
especially when observers react to changes in a subject’s state.
However, the observer typically doesn’t change the state of the subject or
add new behavior to it; instead, it reacts to changes.
In the Decorator, you explicitly wrap and enhance behavior,
but in the Observer, you're typically just reacting to notifications.

So, while they share that flexible, dynamic feel,
decorators are more about extending behavior,
while observers are more about responding to changes.
